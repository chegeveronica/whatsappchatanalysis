Whatsapp group chat analysis
Steps:
1. Create separate functions to get the 4 things contained in a message i.e date, time, authors and the message.
2. Export the group chat without media and put that text file into your project folder where you are working.Use the path to make analysis of the file.
3. Make analysis. Some of the ones I made include:
  *Total messages
  *Total emojis
  *Total link messages
  *Total words and letters
  *Authors individual analysis on their contribution to the group
  *number of unique emojis
  *most used emojis
  *times of the day at which the most number of messages were sent
